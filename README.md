# KidSearch 🔍

**[➡️ Try the Live Demo!](https://laurentftech.github.io/kidsearch)**

A secure and educational search engine designed for children, using Google Custom Search Engine with filtered results and knowledge panels powered by Vikidia.

It's an ideal solution for a **family, an association, or a school** that wants to offer a controlled and safe search environment for kids. You can even set it as the default search engine in the browser for a fully integrated experience. For example, I run it at home on my Synology NAS to provide a secure search experience for my children.

When combined with Google Family Link (or another whitelist system) on Chrome, you can restrict Internet access to child-friendly websites of your choice (and block direct access to google.com, for example).

   ```

2. **Configuration**:
   ```bash
   cp config.example.js config.js
   ```

3. **Edit `config.js`** with your Google Custom Search Engine ID, Google API key and knowledge panels configuration:
   ```javascript
   const CONFIG = {
       GOOGLE_CSE_ID: 'your_cse_id_here',
       GOOGLE_API_KEY: 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE',
       VOICE_SEARCH_ENABLED: true, // Set to false to disable voice search
       KNOWLEDGE_PANEL_CONFIG: {
           ENABLED: true,
           API_URL: 'https://fr.vikidia.org/w/api.php',
           BASE_URL: 'https://fr.vikidia.org/wiki/',
           SOURCE_NAME: 'Vikidia (Encyclopedia for 8-13 year olds)',
           EXTRACT_LENGTH: 300,
           THUMBNAIL_SIZE: 150,
           DISABLE_THUMBNAILS: false
       },
       // Optional: Add your own MeiliSearch instance for custom results
       MEILISEARCH_CONFIG: {
           ENABLED: false, // Set to true to enable
           API_URL: 'https://your-meili-instance.com',
           API_KEY: 'your_meili_search_api_key',
           INDEX_NAME: 'your_index_name',
           SOURCE_NAME: 'My Custom Source',
           WEIGHT: 0.6, // Adjust to prioritize results
           BASE_URLS: ['https://your-website.com'] // Base URLs of indexed sites (to exclude from Google)
       },
       // ... other configs for Wikipedia, Vikidia, etc.
   };
   ```

4. **Host the files on a web server**:
   This project consists of static files and can be hosted on any web server.

   **For local development:**
   You can use a simple local server.
   ```bash
   # With Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Or use the "Live Server" extension in VS Code
   ```
   Then, open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

   **For production:**
   Deploy the files on any static web host (e.g., Synology Web Station, Caddy, Apache, Nginx, AWS, GitHub Pages, etc.).

## Google CSE Configuration

1. Go to [Google Custom Search Engine](https://cse.google.com/)
2. Create a new search engine
3. Add your approved sites in "Sites to search"
4. Enable image search in settings
5. Get your CSE ID (format: `xxx:yyyyy`)
6. Get a Google API key from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
7. Paste credentials in `config.js`

**🔒 Security Tip:** Restrict your Google API key to prevent unauthorized use. In your Google Cloud Console, under "Credentials", edit your API key and set "Application restrictions" to "HTTP referrers (web sites)". Add the URL where you host the project (e.g., `your-domain.com/*`).
**💡 Pro Tip:** For a much richer image search experience, add `commons.wikimedia.org` to your list of "Sites to search". Wikimedia Commons is the media library for Wikipedia and contains millions of high-quality educational images that are well-indexed by Google.
